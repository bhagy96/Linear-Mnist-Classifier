# Linear-Mnist-Classifier

## Overview 

MNIST is a standard digit classification dataset. Given a 28 Ã— 28 image containing a digit from 0 to 9, the goal is deducing which digit the image corresponds to. The dataset has 50,000 training and
10,000 test examples.

The implementation is done using just basic libraries like numpy, and compared with implementation using pytorch

Quadratic loss and minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD)  for training

More details about role of batch size, training-set size are given in the report


## Usage
The notebook can be run on :


 1. Google Collab:
	
	Please Make sure that the necessary are uploaded in the temorary runtime in Google Collab 

 2. Via Jupyter Notebook 
	Additional installations of packages like numpy, pandas, pytorch, tensorflow  may be required.
